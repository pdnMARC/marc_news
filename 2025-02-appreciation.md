The Multidisciplinary AI Research Centre (MARC) at the University of Peradeniya, in collaboration with the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (DEEE), the Department of Manufacturing and Industrial Engineering (DMIE), proudly announces a landmark achievement. Our team has been named as the National Winner in the Best Innovative Product in the Healthtech category, a high-demand AI and software application area, at the prestigious SLASSCOM Sri Lanka, National Ingenuity Awards 2025. This open competition, welcoming universities, innovators, companies, and industries across the nation, saw a group of dedicated undergraduates outperform corporate contenders to secure this esteemed recognition.

Under the expert guidance of academic leaders, the project “Wearable Device and AI-based Analysis for Human Motion Capture” emerged as a testament to years of rigorous development. The winning team comprises Thevindu Samarasekera, Tharinda Navarathne, Buddhini Rathnayaka, Praveen Rathnayaka, Sachintha Adhikari, Oshadha Rathnayake, Mahela Pandukabhaya, Nadeera Meghapathirana, Tharaka D Fonseka, and Madhumini Kulathunge, alongside distinguished academics Prof. Roshan Godaliyadda, Prof. Mervyn Parakrama Ekanayake, Prof. Vijitha R. Herath, Dr. Pramila Gamage, and Dr. Chanaka Senanayake. 

Looking ahead, we anticipate numerous applications, including optimizing manufacturing processes, enhancing sports and biomechanics, improving performance, preventing injuries, mitigating risks, estimating gait and posture, ensuring worker health and safety, and advancing quality assurance in psychomotor tasks. These efforts will be pursued through strategic collaborations, reflecting the industrial potential and innovative nature of this AI-driven research.
This recognition highlights the robust research culture and academic excellence fostered by MARC, DEEE, and DMIE in the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Peradeniya. We extend our gratitude to SLASSCOM and our supporters for this recognition and remain committed to advancing societal impact through cutting-edge research.
